# Numerical-methods-in-C
This C project solves a system of linear equations.

Run the makefile

Takes the following things as input:
1. The number of equations(size of the matrix)
2. The coefficient and resultant matrices

Gives the resultant vector as output

Eg:
Enter the size of the matrix: 3 
Enter the coefficient matrix:

1 2 1

2 2 3  

-1 -3 0 

Enter the resultant vector:

0
3
2

The solution vector Is: [1.00, -1.00, 1.00]


The full2.c is for fitting a polynomial for a given set of data points. It is under construction.
